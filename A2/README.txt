Limerick written by Chat GPT, remixed by Daniel Guo
	Original limerick as follows:
	Daniel:
		"Write me a limerick about using ChatGPT"
	ChatGPT:
		"There once was a person in need,
		Whose knowledge was lacking indeed,
		They found ChatGPT,
		And asked it, you see,
		Now *they're smarter, that's guaranteed!*"
		
		
	Remixed ver.(changes surrounded by '*'):
		"There once was a person in need,
		Whose *creativity* was lacking indeed,
		They found ChatGPT,
		And asked it, you see,
		Now *they certainly got what they need!*"
Note: Remixed due to incorrect(yet guaranteed) information from ChatGPT
